# Auth App Exercise
## Part II - Request interceptors

## Summary
Application with simple token based authentication.

Application provides API for authenticating the user based on credentials (username and password).
We want to authenticate existing user or create new and provide them with access to resources available
only to registered users. Moreover, it should extensively make use of `$stateProvider` abstract views
for authentication.

## Goal

Your goal is to refactor services that you created in last exercise to make use of an interceptor. Instead using
fixed authorization token you should be able to receive token on authentication and automatically use it
in every request until logged out.

For starters, extend `AuthService` by `getToken()` function that will return the current token if it is set.
Be aware that your interceptor should use this method, and you are likely to deal with circular dependency. 
Place your `authInterceptor` in `auth-interceptor-factory.js`, and configure application properly in `app.js`.


## API

**Update user password**

`PATCH /user/password`

**Get current user**

`GET /user/current`

**Register new user**

`POST /user/register`

**Authenticate user**

`POST /auth/login`

**Unauthenticate user**

`POST /auth/logout`

## Setup


To get required service files from the previous branch you can type:

```
git show <previous branch>:app/services/auth/auth-service.js > app/services/auth/auth-service.js
```

```
git show <previous branch>:app/services/user/user-service.js > app/services/user/user-service.js
```

You should have installed `npm, bower, grunt and grunt-cli` packages to run this example.
First, run sequentially:

```
npm install
```
```
bower install
```

To run the application, type:

```
grunt serve
```

It will run application in your default system browser.
